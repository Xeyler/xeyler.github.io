<div class="table-responsive" markdown="1">

|With  |Headers,  |Baby!  |With  |Headers,  |Baby!  |
|:----:|:--------:|:-----:|:----:|:--------:|:-----:|
| 1    | Hello    | World | 1    | Hello    | World |
| 2    | I'm      | Done  | 2    | I'm      | Done  |

</div>

Here's a JS code block:
{% highlight javascript %}
var hello = 'world';
hello += 1;
{% endhighlight %}
