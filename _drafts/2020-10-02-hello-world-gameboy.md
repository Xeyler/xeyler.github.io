  Although it was released more than 30 years ago, programming the Nintendo
  Gameboy can seem complex. Let's review the basics!

Ah, yes. The classic "hello, world". These days, it's just a `printf();` or
even just a `print()` away. But don't be fooled! In almost every case, there's
more going on under the hood than we even recognize. From your terminal
emulator, to your graphics driver, to the _kernel itself_. It's more than
anyone could hope to even grok. Even in the smallest sense of the word!

Fortunately for me and you, we're computer scientists. We know the solution to
understanding complex systems: **Implement them from scratch in assembly, targeting
the Gameboy.**

Let's do it!

Here's a table:

Here's {% include post/link.html url="https://www.google.com" text="a link to Google" %}. Google basically wrote the code for my website.

{% include post/img-figure.html 
	url="/assets/img/profile.jpg"
	caption="I wonder what he's looking at..."
	alt="Brigham staring wistfully into the distance. Perhaps at his lover?"
%}

Here's a JS code block:

{% highlight javascript %}
var hello = 'world';
hello += 1;
{% endhighlight %}
